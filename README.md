## Personal Portfolio
### Groundwork for a personal portfolio website.

Using everything you've learned about responsive design, Sass, and modern techniques like Flexbox, begin laying the groundwork for a personal portfolio website.

For those of you who worked on portfolio sites last week, feel free to continue developing that project as long as it passes the objectives for this review by 5:00pm. That said, if it would be easier to integrate flex-box, or write better Sass by starting with a new project, please do so. If in doubt, start fresh!

Although a planning phase like last week is not required, please consider integrating the kind of wireframing, HTML templating, spec writing, and/or project plan description required last week into this week's README as well!
